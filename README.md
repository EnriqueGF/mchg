# Classic Hunger Games

This gamemode is an hybrid between the old Minecraft HG (Hardcore Games) and modern UHC.

It uses the Spigot API and Maven for the package managing.

# Gamemode Description

When the server starts the world must be generated by zero with a vanilla seed, for this, I suggest to have something like this in the server startup script:

    rmdir /S /q world
    java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar paper-1.18.2-350.jar nogui
    pause

In this way the players will appear in a new random generated world.

When the server is started the minimum user number has to be reached (the value is default hardcoded to 70). Meanwhile, they can select a **KIT** that they will use in the rest of the game when it start:

The default kits are:

**Aquatic**: Trident with Riptide I, Iron Helmet with Oxygen I

**Archer**: Bow Power I, 10 arrows

**Armorer**: Iron Sword, Shield

**Blacksmith**: Iron leggings, Iron boots

**Enderman**: 5 ender pearls, shulker box

**Explosive**: Flint and steel, Leather leggings, 4 apples

**Farmer**: 10 wheat seeds, Golden Apple, 5 pumpkin pie

**Fisherman**: 5 Cooked Salmons, Leather Leggings, Leather boots

**Horse Rider**: Horse spawn egg, saddle, Horse diamond armour

**Hunter**: You get a domesticated wolf. Iron Sword.

**Miner**: Iron Pickaxe with Efficiency I. Iron Shovel with Efficiency I. 10 Torches.


While the players are waiting the game for start, they can explore the entire world (it's delimitated by a worldborder).

Once the game will start, there will be a countdown and it will start a vulnerability period where players have to survive but PvP will still not be enabled.

(Ignore the "Congrats" I forced the game to start with only 1 player)

As you can see when the game starts the kit applies to you and the Invulnerability period begin. In this time players will have 5 minutes to search for a place to survive.

When the time pass, PvP will be enabled and the **Worldborder** will start to close.

**The fewer players that remain, the faster the edge of the world closes, like battle royale style.**

There are some other mechanics like in the top bar you can see the distance from you to the border, other mechanics like detecting players with a compass, etc, but I'm too lazy for writing them all.

Have fun
